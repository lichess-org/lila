Lila (li[chess in sca]la) is a free online chess game server focused on [realtime](https://lichess.org/games) gameplay and ease of use.

It features a [search engine](https://lichess.org/games/search),
[computer analysis](https://lichess.org/ief49lif) distributed with [fishnet](https://github.com/niklasf/fishnet),
[tournaments](https://lichess.org/tournament),
[simuls](https://lichess.org/simul),
[forums](https://lichess.org/forum),
[teams](https://lichess.org/team),
[tactic trainer](https://lichess.org/training),
a [mobile app](https://lichess.org/mobile),
and a [shared analysis board](https://lichess.org/study).
The UI is available in more than [80 languages](https://crowdin.com/project/lichess) thanks to the community.

Lichess is written in [Scala 2.11](https://www.scala-lang.org/),
and relies on [Play 2.4](https://www.playframework.com/) for the routing, templating, and JSON.
Pure chess logic is contained in [scalachess](https://github.com/ornicar/scalachess) submodule.
The server is fully asynchronous, making heavy use of Scala Futures and [Akka 2 actors](http://akka.io).
Lichess talks to [Stockfish](http://stockfishchess.org/) deployed in an [AI cluster](https://github.com/niklasf/fishnet) of donated servers.
It uses [MongoDB 3.4](https://mongodb.org) to store more than 600 million games, which are indexed by [elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org).
HTTP requests and websocket connections are proxied by [nginx 1.9](http://nginx.org).
The web client is written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom).
The [blog](https://lichess.org/blog) uses a free open content plan from [prismic.io](https://prismic.io).
All rated standard games are published in a [free PGN database](https://database.lichess.org).
Browser testing done with [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ornicar/lila/master/public/images/browserstack.png)](https://www.browserstack.com).

Installation
------------

> If you want to add a live chess section to your website, you are welcome to [embed lichess](https://lichess.org/developers) into your website. It's very easy to do.

> This project source code is open for other developers to have an example of non-trivial scala/play2/mongodb application. You're welcome to reuse as much code as you want for your projects and to get inspired by the solutions I propose to many common web development problems. But please don't just create a public lichess clone. Instead, [embed lichess using an &lt;iframe&gt;](https://lichess.org/developers) into your website.

> Also note that while I provide the source code, I do **not** offer support for your lichess instance. I will probably ignore any question about lichess installation and runtime issues.
