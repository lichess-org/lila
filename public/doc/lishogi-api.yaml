    # Introduction
    Welcome to the reference for the Lishogi API! Lishogi is free/libre,
    open-source shogi server forked from lichess powered by volunteers and donations.

    Currently this page is a work in progress, certain information here might be wrong and incorrect!
    Expect it to be done during 2022.
    - Get help in the [Lishogi Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YFtpMGg3rR)
    - [Contribute to this documentation on Github](https://github.com/WandererXII/lishogi/blob/master/public/doc/lishogi-api.yaml)
    - Check out [Lishogi widgets to embed in your website](https://lishogi.org/developers)

    ## Endpoint
    All requests go to `https://lishogi.org` (unless otherwise specified).

    ## Rate limiting
    All requests are rate limited using various strategies,
    to ensure the API remains responsive for everyone.
    Only make one request at a time.
    If you receive an HTTP response with a [429 status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#429),
    please wait a full minute before resuming API usage.

    ## Streaming with ND-JSON
    Some API endpoints stream their responses as [Newline Delimited JSON a.k.a. **nd-json**](http://ndjson.org/), with one JSON object per line.

    Here's a [JavaScript utility function (for lichess)](https://gist.github.com/ornicar/a097406810939cf7be1df8ea30e94f3e) to help reading NDJSON streamed responses.

        This API is very fast and cheap on lishogi side.
        So you can call it quite often (like once every 5 seconds).

        Use it to track players and know when they're connected on lishogi and playing games.

        A description of the game is sent as a first message.
        Then a message is sent each time a move is played.
        Finally a description of the game is sent when it finishes, and the stream is closed.

        After move 5, the stream intentionally remains 3 moves behind the game status, as to prevent cheat bots from using this API.

        No more than 8 game streams can be opened at the same time from the same IP address.

      description: |
        Upgrade a lishogi player account into a Bot account. Only Bot accounts can use the Bot API.

        The account **cannot have played any game** before becoming a Bot account. The upgrade is **irreversible**. The account will only be able to play as a Bot.

        To upgrade an account to Bot, use the [official lishogi-bot client](https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lishogi-bot), or follow these steps:
        - Create an [API access token](https://lishogi.org/account/oauth/token/create?scopes[]=bot:play) with "Play bot moves" permission.
        - `curl -d '' https://lishogi.org/api/bot/account/upgrade -H "Authorization: Bearer <yourTokenHere>"`

        To know if an account has already been upgraded, use the [Get my profile API](#operation/accountMe):
        the `title` field should be set to `BOT`.

        If you also have an OAuth token with `challenge:write` scope for the receiving user,

                    Message that is sent to each player, when the game is created. It is sent from your user account.

                    `{opponent}`, `{player}` and `{game}` are placeholders that will be replaced with the opponent name, player name, and the game URLs.

                    You can omit this field to send the default message,
                    but if you set your own message, it must at least contain the `{game}` placeholder.
                  default: "Your game with {opponent} is ready: {game}."

        ### Which authentication method is right for me?
        [Read about the Lichess (Currently not made for Lishogi) API authentication methods and code examples](https://github.com/lichess-org/api/blob/master/example/README.md)

        ### Personal Access Token
        Personal API access tokens allow you to quickly interact with Lishogi API without going through an OAuth flow.
        - [Generate a personal access token](https://lishogi.org/account/oauth/token)
        - `curl https://lishogi.org/api/account -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"`
        - [NodeJS example (for lichess)](https://github.com/lichess-org/api/tree/master/example/oauth-personal-token)

        #### Real life examples
        - [Lishogi Discord Bot](https://top.gg/bot/842330057841049600) ([source code](https://github.com/ddugovic/lishogi-discord))
        - [Lishogi Bot](https://github.com/TheYoBots/Lishogi-Bot)

        ### Token format
        Access tokens and authorization codes match `^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$`.
        The length of tokens can be increased without notice. Make sure your application can handle at least 512 characters.
        By convention tokens have a recognizable prefix, but do not rely on this.
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://lishogi.org/oauth
          tokenUrl: https://lishogi.org/api/token
