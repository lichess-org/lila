    # Introduction
    Welcome to the reference for the Lishogi API! Lishogi is free/libre,
    open-source shogi server forked from lichess powered by volunteers and donations.

    Currently this page is a work in progress, information here is most likely wrong and incorrect!
    Expect it to be done during August 22.
    - Get help in the [Lishogi Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YFtpMGg3rR)
    - [Contribute to this documentation on Github](https://github.com/WandererXII/lishogi/public/doc)
    - Check out [Lishogi widgets to embed in your website](https://lishogi.org/developers)

    ## Endpoint
    All requests go to `https://lishogi.org` (unless otherwise specified).

    ## Rate limiting
    All requests are rate limited using various strategies,
    to ensure the API remains responsive for everyone.
    Only make one request at a time.
    If you receive an HTTP response with a [429 status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#429),
    please wait a full minute before resuming API usage.

    ## Streaming with ND-JSON
    Some API endpoints stream their responses as [Newline Delimited JSON a.k.a. **nd-json**](http://ndjson.org/), with one JSON object per line.

    Here's a [JavaScript utility function](https://gist.github.com/ornicar/a097406810939cf7be1df8ea30e94f3e) to help reading NDJSON streamed responses.

      summary: Stream an ongoing broadcast tournament as PGN
      description: |
        This streaming endpoint first sends all games of a broadcast tournament in PGN format.

        Then, it waits for new moves to be played. As soon as it happens, the entire PGN of the game is sent to the stream.

        The stream will also send PGNs when games are added to the tournament.

        This is the best way to get updates about an ongoing tournament. Streaming means no polling,
        and no pollings means no latency, and minimum impact on the server.

        Upgrade a lishogi player account into a Bot account. Only Bot accounts can use the Bot API.

        The account **cannot have played any game** before becoming a Bot account. The upgrade is **irreversible**. The account will only be able to play as a Bot.

        To upgrade an account to Bot, use the [official lishogi-bot client](https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lishogi-bot), or follow these steps:
        - Create an [API access token](https://lishogi.org/account/oauth/token/create?scopes[]=bot:play) with "Play bot moves" permission.
        - `curl -d '' https://lishogi.org/api/bot/account/upgrade -H "Authorization: Bearer <yourTokenHere>"`

        To know if an account has already been upgraded, use the [Get my profile API](#operation/accountMe):
        the `title` field should be set to `BOT`.

      summary: Create a challenge
      description: |
        Challenge someone to play. The targeted player can choose to accept or decline.

        If the challenge is accepted, you will be notified on the [event stream](#operation/apiStreamEvent)
        that a new game has started. The game ID will be the same as the challenge ID.

        If you also have an OAuth token with `challenge:write` scope for the receiving user,
        you can make them accept the challenge immediately by setting the `acceptByToken` field.

        Challenges for realtime games (not correspondence) expire after 20s if not accepted.
        To prevent that, use the `keepAliveStream` flag described below.

      description: |
        Schedule many games at once, up to 24h in advance.

        OAuth tokens are required for all paired players, with the `challenge:write` scope.

        You can schedule up to 500 games every 10 minutes. [Contact us](mailto:contact@lishogi.org) if you need higher limits.

        The entire bulk is rejected if:
          - a token is missing
          - a token is present more than once
          - a token lacks the `challenge:write` scope
          - a player account is closed
          - a player is paired more than once
          - a bulk is already scheduled to start at the same time with the same player
          - you have 10 scheduled bulks
          - you have 1000 scheduled games

        Partial bulks are never created. Either it all fails, or it all succeeds.
        When it fails, it does so with an error message explaining the issue.
        Failed bulks are not counted in the rate limiting, they are free.
        Fix the issues, manually or programmatically, then retry to schedule the bulk.

        A successful bulk creation returns a JSON bulk document. Its ID can be used for further operations.

                    The 2 tokens of the players of a game are separated with `:`. The first token gets the sente pieces. Games are separated with `,`.

                    Up to 1000 tokens can be sent, for a max of 500 games.

                    Each token must be included at most once.

        OAuth2 authorization endpoint.

        Start the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE by securely
        generating two random strings unique to each authorization
        request:
        * `code_verifier`
        * `state`

        Store these in session storage. Make sure not to reveal `code_verifier`
        to eavesdroppers. Do not show it in URLs, do not abuse `state` to store
        it, do not send it over insecure connections. However it is fine if
        the user themselves can extract `code_verifier`, which will always be
        possible for fully client-side apps.

        Then send the user to this endpoint. They will be prompted to grant
        authorization and then be redirected back to the given `redirect_uri`.

        If the authorization failed, the following query string parameters will
        be appended to the redirection:
        * `error`, in particular with value `access_denied` if the user
           cancelled authorization
        * `error_description` to aid debugging
        * `state`, exactly as passed in the `state` parameter

        If the authorization succeeded, the following query string parameters
        will be appended to the redirection:
        * `code`, containing a fresh short-lived authorization code
        * `state`, exactly as passed in the `state` parameter

        Next, to defend against cross site request forgery, check that the
        returned `state` matches the `state` you originally generated.

        Finally, continue by using the authorization code to
        [obtain an access token](#operation/apiToken).

        ### Which authentication method is right for me?
        [Read about the Lishogi API authentication methods and code examples](https://github.com/lishogi-org/api/blob/master/example/README.md)

        ### Personal Access Token
        Personal API access tokens allow you to quickly interact with Lishogi API without going through an OAuth flow.
        - [Generate a personal access token](https://lishogi.org/account/oauth/token)
        - `curl https://lishogi.org/api/account -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"`
        - [NodeJS example](https://github.com/lishogi-org/api/tree/master/example/oauth-personal-token)

        ### Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
        The authorization code flow with PKCE allows your users to **login with Lishogi**.
        Lishogi supports unregistered and public clients (no client authentication, choose any unique client id).
        The only accepted code challenge method is `S256`.
        Access tokens are long-lived (expect one year), unless they are revoked.
        Refresh tokens are not supported.

        See the [documentation for the OAuth endpoints](#tag/OAuth) or
        the [PKCE RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4) for a precise protocol description.

        - [Demo app](https://lishogi-org.github.io/api-demo/)
        - [Minimal client-side example](https://github.com/lishogi-org/api/tree/master/example/oauth-app)
        - [Flask/Python example](https://github.com/lakinwecker/lishogi-oauth-flask)
        - [Java example](https://github.com/tors42/lishogi-oauth-pkce-app)
        - [NodeJS Passport strategy to login with Lishogi OAuth2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-lishogi)

        - [Rotherham Online Chess](https://rotherhamonlinechess.azurewebsites.net/tournaments)

        ### Token format
        Access tokens and authorization codes match `^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$`.
        The length of tokens can be increased without notice. Make sure your application can handle at least 512 characters.
        By convention tokens have a recognizable prefix, but do not rely on this.
