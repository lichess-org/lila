ui/build was lovingly crafted from a single block of wood as a personal gift to you.

  ./build <options> <packages> # packages are top level directories in ui
  one letter options can be consolidated after a single dash (e.g. -cdw)
  if no packages are specified, all will be processed

Options:
  -h, --help          show this help and exit
  -w, --watch         build and watch for changes
  -c, --clean-build   clean build artifacts then build
  -p, --prod          build minified assets (prod builds)
  -n, --no-install    don't run pnpm install
  -d, --debug         build assets with site.debug = true
  -l, --log=<url>     monkey patch console log functions in javascript manifest to POST log messages to
                      <url> or localhost:8666 (default). if used with --watch, the ui/build process
                      will listen for http on 8666 and display received json as 'web' in build logs
  --clean             clean all build artifacts and exit
  --update            update ui/build's node_modules
  --no-color          don't use color in logs
  --no-time           don't log the time
  --no-context        don't log the context
  --tsc               run tsc, any of [--tsc, --sass, --esbuild, --copies] will disable the others
  --sass              run sass on {package}/css/build/*.scss and dependencies
  --esbuild           run esbuild (given in {package}/package.json/lichess/bundles array)
  --copies            run copies (given in {package}/package.json/lichess/sync objects)

Examples:
  ./build -w                 # build and watch for changes <- this is the most common use case
  ./build -wc                # clean build, watch <- recommended for maintainers
  ./build -w --log=/path     # build, watch, and patch js console POST to ${location.origin}/path. 
                             # ui/build listens on 8666, displays received json as 'web' over stdout
  ./build -np                # no pnpm install, build minified
  ./build analyse site msg   # build analyse, site, and msg packages (as opposed to everything)
  ./build -w dasher chart    # watch mode for dasher and chart packages
  ./build --tsc -w           # watch mode but type checking only
  ./build --sass msg notify  # build css only for msg and notify packages
