#### I want to report a bug or a problem about Lichess.

[__Make an issue ticket.__](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/issues/new?title=Submitting a forum thread with the word "thibault" in its title crashes my browser!) However, note that issues that provide little value compared to the required effort may be closed. Before creating an issue, make sure that:

1. You list the steps to reproduce the problem to show that other users may experience it as well, if the issue is not self-descriptive.
2. Search to make sure it isn't a duplicate [The advanced search syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) may come in handy.
3. It is not a trivial problem or demand unrealistic dev time to fix - Pluralization bugs and the such fall under this category.

#### I want to suggest a feature for Lichess.

Issue tickets on features that lack potential or effectiveness are not useful and may be closed. Discussions regarding whether a proposed new feature would be useful can be done on [The Lichess Feedback Forum](http://lichess.org/forum/lichess-feedback) to gauge feedback. The developers may also discuss the idea there, and if it is exemplary, a corresponding issue ticket will be made. __When you're ready, [make an issue ticket](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/issues/new?title=Please implement this chess variant idea I came up with)__ and link relevant, constructive comments regarding it in your issue ticket (such as a detailed Reddit post; Linking to an empty forum thread with only your own commentary adds no value). Make sure that the feature you propose:

1. Is __effective in delivering a goal__. A feature that adds nothing new is purely fancy; Please develop a userscript or userstyle for your personal use instead.
2. Doesn't rely on mundane assumptions. Non-technical people have the tendency to measure how difficult / easy a feature is to implement based on their unreliable instincts, and such assumptions wastes everyone's time. __Point out what needs to happen__, not what you think will happen.
3. Is __unique, if you're aiming to solve a problem__. Features that can easily be replaced by easier ideas have little value and may not have to be brought up to begin with.
4. Is __clear and concise__. If ambiguities exist, define them or propose options.
