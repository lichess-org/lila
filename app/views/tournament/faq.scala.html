  You will be notified when the tournament starts, so it is safe to
  <a target="_blank" href="@routes.Lobby.home()">play in another tab</a> while waiting.

  <h2>Is it rated?</h2>
  @rated.map { r =>
  @if(r) {
  This tournament is rated and will affect your rating.

  <h2>How are scores calculated?</h2>
  @system match {
  case Some(System.Arena) => {
  A win has a base score of 2 points, a draw: 1 point, and a loss is worth no points.
  If you win two games consecutively you will start a double point streak, known as a
  <span class="streakstarter">Streak Starter</span>.
  The following games will continue to be worth <span class="double">Double Points</span> until you fail to win
  a game. That is, a win will be worth 4 points, a draw: 2 points, and a loss will remain
  worth no points.
  <br />
  For example, two wins followed by a draw will be worth 6 points: 2 + 2 + (2 x 1)

  <h2>Arena Berserk</h2>
  When a player clicks the <em>Berserk</em> button at the beginning of the game,
  they lose half of their clock time, but the win is worth one extra tournament point.
  <br />
  <em>Berserk</em> is not available when the clock has an increment (like 0+1 or 5+2).
  }
  case Some(System.Swiss) => {
  A win is worth 1 point, a draw: Â½ point, and a loss is worth no points. If at
  a given round there are an odd number of players, the player which does not get
  assigned a pairing receives a bye. A bye is worth as much as a victory.
  <br />
  To break ties, an additional score is computed as the sum of the scores of
  defeated opponents plus half of the sum of the scores of drawn opponents. This
  tie-breaker, called the Neustadtl or Sonnenborn-Berger score, is indicated in
  parentheses next to the standard score.
  }
  case _ => {
  How scores are calculated depends on the system used for the tournament. In
  all cases a win is worth twice as much as a draw, and a loss is worth no
  points. In the Arena system, winning games in succession yields an additional
  bonus. In the Swiss system, winning against stronger opponents helps in tie
  breaks.
  }
  }

  <h2>How is the winner decided?</h2>
  The player(s) with the most points at the conclusion of the tournament's set time limit
  will be announced winner(s).

  <h2>How does the pairing work?</h2>
  @system match {
  case Some(System.Arena) => {
  At the beginning of the tournament, players are paired randomly.
  As soon as you finish a game, return to the tournament lobby:
  you will then be paired with the first available player. This ensures minimum wait time,
  however you may not face all other players in the tournament.
  Play fast and return to the lobby to play more games and win more points.
  }
  case Some(System.Swiss) => {
  Pairings are generated on a round basis, meaning everyone plays the same
  number of games.  Players with equal scores in the tournament are paired
  together to the extent possible. Two players can play against each other at
  most once in the tournament. The system additionally ensures that each player
  plays approximately as often as white and as black.
  }
  case _ => {
  The pairing mechanism depends on the system used for the tournament. In the
  Arena system, new pairings are generated as soon as enough players are
  available in the lobby, in with the Swiss system, pairings are generated on
  a round basis.
  }
  }

  <h2>How does it end?</h2>
  The tournament has a countdown clock.
  When it reaches zero, the tournament rankings are frozen, and the winner is announced.
  Games in progress must be finished, however they don't count for the tournament.

  <h2>Other important rules.</h2>
  You are required to make your first move within 15 seconds of your turn. Failing to make
  a move in this time will forfeit the game to your opponent.
  <br />
  Drawing the game within the first 10 moves of play will earn neither player any points.
