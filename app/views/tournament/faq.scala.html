## When will the tournament start?
As soon as @players players join it.
}
You will be notified when the tournament starts, so it is safe to
<a target="_blank" href="@routes.Lobby.home()">play in another tab</a> while waiting.

## Is it rated?
@rated.map { r =>
@if(r) {
This tournaments is rated and will affect your Rating.
} else {
This tournaments is *not* rated and will *not* affect your Rating.
}
}.getOrElse {
Some tournaments are rated and will affect your Rating.
}

## How are scores calculated?
A win has a base score of 2 points, a draw: 1 point, and a loss is worth no points.
If you win two games consecutively you will start a double point streak, known as a 
<span class="streakstarter">Streak Starter</span>.
The following games will continue to be worth <span class="double">Double Points</span> until you fail to win
a game. That is, a win will be worth 4 points, a draw: 2 points, and a loss will remain
worth no points.

For example, two wins followed by a draw will be worth 6 points: 2 + 2 + 2x1

## How is the winner decided?
The player(s) with the most points at the conclusion of the tournament's set time limit 
will be announced winner(s).

## How does the pairing work?
At the beginning of the tournament, players are paired randomly.
As soon as you finish a game, return to the tournament lobby:
you will then be paired with the first available player. This ensures minimum wait time,
however you may not verse all other players in the tournament.
Play fast and return to the lobby to play more games and win more points.

## How does it end?
The tournament has a countdown clock. When it reaches zero all current tournament games
are aborted; the tournament rankings are frozen, and the winner is announced.

## Other important rules.
You are required to make your first move within 30 seconds of your turn. Failing to make
a move in this time will forfeit the game to your opponent.

Drawing the game within the first 10 moves of play will earn neither player any points.
