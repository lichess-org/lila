  <p>
    To ensure honest players aren't falsely accused of cheating, we request titled players
    to identify themselves. For instance, <a href="@routes.User.show("jeffforever")">jeffforever</a> and
    <a href="@routes.User.show("milacek")">milacek</a> are verified FIDE master, and Grandmaster respectively.
    Identification can be performed in a number of ways, and you can choose to remain anonymous.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to verify your title, you can take a picture of an ID document,
    and send it to the email
    <a href="mailto:@email" title="About title verification">@email</a>. 
    This can include birth certificates, drivers licences, passports, visas, and more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alternatively you can write a statement about lichess on a website where you are recognised
    as who you claim to be. It could be twitter, facebook, chess.com or anything serious enough.
    Then, send us a link to your post.
  </p>

  <p>
    Go ahead now and verify your title!
    If you need help or have any question,
    feel free to ask <a href="@routes.User.show("thibault")">thibault</a>,
    the developer of the site, using
    <a href="@routes.Message.form()?user=thibault&title=About title verification">
      lichess messages
    </a>, or by email at
    <a href="mailto:@email" title="About title verification">@email</a>.

  <p class="actions">
