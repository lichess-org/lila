	<string name="whyIsLishogiCalledLishogi">為什麼叫做Lishogi呢?</string>
	<string name="forkedFromLichess">Lishogi 是一個從 Lichess 分支出來的開源專案，但因為這個網站只專注於將棋，我們便稱他為 Lishogi。</string>
	<string name="lishogiCombinationLiveLightLibrePronounced">Because it\'s derived from Lichess. And Lichess is called Lichess because it\'s a combination of live/light/libre and chess. Lishogi is pronounced %1$s.</string>
	<string name="leeshogi">lee-shogi</string>
	<string name="whyLiveLightLibre">直播(live)，無時無刻都有人在下棋，而每一場棋局也都被觀賞。光明及自由(light and libre) 代表Lishogi是開源軟體及不被版權蟑螂影響。</string>
	<string name="whyIsLilaCalledLila">Similarly, the source code for Lishogi, %1$s, stands for li[shogi in sca]la, seeing as the bulk of Lishogi is written in %2$s, an intuitive programming language.</string>
	<string name="howCanIContributeToLishogi">How can I contribute to Lishogi?</string>
	<string name="lishogiPoweredByDonationsAndVolunteers">Lishogi能夠順利運作是因為有許多人的贊助以及一群自願者的努力。</string>
	<string name="beingAPatron">成為贊助者</string>
	<string name="otherWaysToContribute">這裡有許多許多其他方法您可以為Lishogi做出貢獻。</string>
	<string name="breakdownOfOurCosts">經費收支</string>

	<string name="fairPlay">公平的下棋</string>
	<string name="whyFlaggedRatingManipulationOrCheater">為什麼我被警告有人為操控積分(例如：送分) 或是有電腦輔助？</string>
	<string name="cheatDetectionMethods">Lishogi有強大的檢測方式以及非常徹底的過程來檢閱每一個證據，並作出判決。這過程通常需要很多的仲裁者並可能花上一段時間。
除了標記，我們將不會公布個案的細節及辦決過程。這樣可能會導致鑽漏洞的情形更容易出現，以及產生許多無意義的辯論。這些時間及精力應該花在更重要的案件上。用戶可以通過電子郵件%1$s來上訴，但裁決被推翻的情況很少出現。</string>
	<string name="whenAmIEligibleRatinRefund">我什麼時候可以有資格自動取回與作弊者對弈的積分？</string>
	<string name="ratingRefundExplanation">在一個棋手被標記的一分鐘後，他們最近的40局積分賽將在3天內無效。如過你是他們這幾局的對手並且積分不是浮動的狀態，你輸掉的積分(輸局或和局) 將會退回，退回的積分上限基於你的最高積分及在那些棋局之後的積分變化。
(例如：你如果在那些棋局之後積分大幅提升，你可能就不會拿回那些積分或是只拿回一部分)。且退回的積分永遠不會超過150分。</string>
	<string name="preventLeavingGameWithoutResigning">對那些沒有認輸就離開棋局的棋手會怎麼處理？</string>
	<string name="leavingGameWithoutResigningExplanation">如果你的對手經常放棄／中離棋局，他們會受到＂禁止對弈＂的懲罰。代表他們暫時無法對弈。這不會顯示在他們的個人資料上。如果情況未改善，每次懲罰的時間將會延長，並有可能導致帳號被封鎖。</string>
	<string name="howCanIBecomeModerator">我要如何成為一個仲裁者？</string>
	<string name="youCannotApply">你無法主動申請成為一個仲裁者。如果我們看到我們認為有能力擔任仲裁者的人，我們會主動聯繫他們。</string>
	<string name="isCorrespondenceDifferent">通訊賽和常規賽有差異嗎？</string>
	<string name="youCanUseOpeningBookNoEngine">在Lishogi，兩者的最大的規則差異在通信賽可以使用序盤資料庫。但電腦輔助一樣是禁止的，並一樣會被標記為電腦輔助的使用者。
即便在ICCF允許在通信賽中使用電腦輔助，但Lishogi不行。</string>
	<string name="gameplay">下棋</string>
	<string name="howBulletBlitzEtcDecided">Bullet、Blitz和其他模式的時限是怎麼決定的？</string>
	<string name="basedOnGameDuration">Lishogi上的時限基於預期的對弈時間 %1$s
例如，5+3的預期對弈時間為 5 × 60 + 40 × 3 = 420秒。</string>
	<string name="formulaOfDuration">60 × (clock initial time in minutes) + 60 × (clock increment) + 25 × (clock byoyomi) × (clock periods)</string>
	<string name="inferiorThanXsEqualYtimeControl">≤ %1$ss = %2$s</string>
	<string name="superiorThanXsEqualYtimeControl">≥ %1$ss = %2$s</string>
	<string name="whatVariantsCanIplay">有哪些變體是在Lishogi上玩得到的？</string>
	<string name="lishogiSupportShogiAnd">Lishogi supports standard shogi and %1$s.</string>
	<string name="whatIsACPL">平均釐兵損失 (ACPL) 是什麼？</string>
	<string name="acplExplanation">釐兵是國際象棋計算優勢所用的計量單位。1釐兵等於兵價值的1/100。也就是說，100釐兵=1兵。這些價值在游戲中不起正式作用，但對玩家有用，對電腦來評估局面也很重要。

最佳的電腦著法將會損失0釐兵，但較差的著法將導致釐兵計量下局面的惡化。

該值可以用作著法質量的一個指標。每次失去的釐兵越少，著法就越強。

Lishogi上的電腦分析是基於Stockfish的。</string>

We rarely award it to highly notable players who are good citizens of Lishogi, at our discretion. You don\'t get the LM title, the LM title gets to you. If you qualify, you will get a message from us regarding it and the choice to accept or decline.

	<string name="lishogiRatings">Lishogi積分</string>
	<string name="whichRatingSystemUsedByLishogi">Lishogi 使用什麼評分機制?</string>
	<string name="ratingSystemUsedByLishogi">Ratings are calculated using the Glicko-2 rating method developed by Mark Glickman. This is a very popular rating method, and is used by a significant number of chess organisations (FIDE being a notable counter-example, as they still use the dated Elo rating system).

Fundamentally, Glicko ratings use \"confidence intervals\" when calculating and representing your rating. When you first start using the site, your rating starts at 1500 ± 700. The 1500 represents your rating, and the 700 represents the confidence interval.

Basically, the system is 90% sure that your rating is somewhere between 800 and 2200. It is incredibly uncertain. Because of this, when a player is just starting out, their rating will change very dramatically, potentially several hundred points at a time. But after some games against established players the confidence interval will narrow, and the amount of points gained/lost after each game will decrease.

Another point to note is that, as time passes, the confidence interval will increase. This allows you to gain/lose points points more rapidly to match any changes in your skill level over that time.</string>
	<string name="whatIsProvisionalRating">為什麼積分的旁邊有個問號(?)</string>
	<string name="provisionalRatingExplanation">The question mark means the rating is provisional. Reasons include:</string>
	<string name="notPlayedEnoughRatedGamesAgainstX">The player has not yet finished enough rated games against %1$s in the rating category.</string>
	<string name="similarOpponents">實力相近的對手</string>
	<string name="notPlayedRecently">The player hasn\'t played enough recent games. Depending on the number of games you\'ve played, it might take around a year of inactivity for your rating to become provisional again.</string>
	<string name="ratingDeviationMorethanOneHundredTen">Concretely, it means that the Glicko-2 deviation is greater than 110. The deviation is the level of confidence the system has in the rating. The lower the deviation, the more stable is a rating.</string>
	<string name="howDoLeaderoardsWork">排名和排行榜是如何運作的?</string>
	<string name="inOrderToAppearsYouMust">In order to get on the %1$s you must:</string>
	<string name="ratingLeaderboards">評分排行表</string>
	<string name="havePlayedMoreThanThirtyGamesInThatRating">have played at least 30 rated games in a given rating,</string>
	<string name="havePlayedARatedGameAtLeastOneWeekAgo">have played a rated game within the last week for this rating,</string>
	<string name="ratingDeviationLowerThanXinShogiYinVariants">have a rating deviation lower than %1$s, in standard shogi, and lower than %2$s in variants,</string>
	<string name="beInTopTen">在此模式下得到前10的積分</string>
	<string name="secondRequirementToStopOldPlayersTrustingLeaderboards">The 2nd requirement is so that players who no longer use their accounts stop populating leaderboards.</string>
	<string name="whyAreRatingHigher">Why are ratings different compared to other sites and organisations such as 81Dojo and Shogi Club 24?</string>
	<string name="whyAreRatingHigherExplanation">It is best not to think of ratings as absolute numbers, or compare them against other organisations. Different organisations have different levels of players, different rating systems (Elo, Glicko, Glicko-2, or a modified version of the aforementioned). These factors can drastically affect the absolute numbers (ratings).

It\'s best to think of ratings as \"relative\" figures (as opposed to \"absolute\" figures): Within a pool of players, their relative differences in ratings will help you estimate who will win/draw/lose, and how often. Saying \"I have X rating\" means nothing unless there are other players to compare that rating to.</string>
	<string name="howToHideRatingWhilePlaying">如何在奕棋時隱藏評分?</string>
	<string name="enableZenMode">Enable Zen-mode in the %1$s, or by pressing %2$s during a game.</string>
	<string name="displayPreferences">顯示設定</string>
	<string name="connexionLostCanIGetMyRatingBack">我因為斷線或lag而導致我輸了。我可以加回我的分數嗎?</string>
	<string name="weCannotDoThatEvenIfItIsServerSideButThatsRare">Unfortunately, we cannot give back rating points for games lost due to lag or disconnection, regardless of whether the problem was at your end or our end. The latter is very rare though. Also note that when Lishogi restarts and you lose on time because of that, we abort the game to prevent an unfair loss.</string>
