  <string name="lichessCombinationLiveLightLibrePronounced">Lichess is a combination of live/light/libre and chess. It is pronounced %1$s.</string>
  <string name="leechess">LEE-CHESS</string>
  <string name="hearItPronouncedBySpecialist">Hear it pronounced by a specialist.</string>
  <string name="whyLiveLightLibre">Live, because games are played and watched in real-time 24/7; light and libre for the fact that Lichess is open-source and unencumbered by proprietary junk that plagues other websites.</string>
  <string name="whyIsLilaCalledLila">Similarly, the source code for Lichess, %1$s, stands for li[chess in sca]la, seeing as the bulk of Lichess is written in %2$s, an intuitive programming language.</string>
  <string name="howCanIContributeToLichess">How can I contribute to Lichess?</string>
  <string name="lichessPoweredByDonationsAndVolunteers">Lichess is powered by donations from patrons and the efforts of a team of volunteers.</string>

  <string name="areThereWebsitesBasedOnLichess">Are there websites based on Lichess?</string>
  <string name="yesLichessInspiredOtherOpenSourceWebsites">Yes. Lichess has indeed inspired other open-source sites that use our %1$s, %2$s, or %3$s.</string>
  <string name="fairPlay">Fair Play</string>
  <string name="whyFlaggedRatingManipulationOrCheater">Why am I flagged for artificial rating manipulation (sandbagging and boosting) or computer assistance?</string>
  <string name="cheatDetectionMethods">Lichess has strong detection methods and a very thorough process for reviewing all the evidence and making a decision. The process often involves many moderators and can take a long time. Other than the mark itself, we will not go into details about evidence or the decision making process for individual cases. Doing so would make it easier to avoid detection in the future, and be an invitation to unproductive debates. That time and effort is better spent on other important cases. Users can appeal by emailing %1$s, but decisions are rarely overturned.</string>
  <string name="whenAmIEligibleRatinRefund">When am I eligible for the automatic rating refund from cheaters?</string>
  <string name="ratingRefundExplanation">One minute after a player is marked, their 40 latest rated games in the last 3 days are taken. If you are their opponent in those games, you lost rating (because of a loss or a draw), and your rating was not provisional, you get a rating refund. The refund is capped based on your peak rating and your rating progress after the game.
  (For example, if your rating greatly increased after those games, you might get no refund or only a partial refund.) A refund will never exceed 150 points.</string>
  <string name="preventLeavingGameWithoutResigning">What is done about players leaving games without resigning?</string>
  <string name="leavingGameWithoutResigningExplanation">If your opponent frequently aborts/leaves games, they get \"play banned\", which means they\'re temporarily banned from playing games. This is not publicly indicated on their profile. If this behavior continues, the length of the playban increases - and prolonged behavior of this nature may lead to account closure.</string>
  <string name="howCanIBecomeModerator">How can I become a moderator?</string>
  <string name="youCannotApply">It is not possible to apply to become a moderator. If we see someone who we think would be good as a moderator, we will contact them directly.</string>
  <string name="isCorrespondenceDifferent">Is correspondence different from normal chess?</string>
  <string name="youCanUseOpeningBookNoEngine">On Lichess, the main difference in rules for correspondence chess is that an opening book is allowed. The use of engines is still prohibited and will result in being flagged for engine assistance. Although ICCF allows engine use in correspondence, Lichess does not.</string>
  <string name="gameplay">Gameplay</string>
  <string name="howBulletBlitzEtcDecided">How are Bullet, Blitz and other time controls decided?</string>
  <string name="basedOnGameDuration">Lichess time controls are based on estimated game duration = %1$s
For instance, the estimated duration of a 5+3 game is 5 × 60 + 40 × 3 = 420 seconds.</string>
  <string name="durationFormula">(clock initial time) + 40 × (clock increment)</string>
  <string name="inferiorThanXsEqualYtimeControl">≤ %1$ss = %2$s</string>

  <string name="eightVariants">8 chess variants</string>
  <string name="whatIsACPL">What is the average centipawn loss (ACPL)?</string>
  <string name="acplExplanation">The centipawn is the unit of measure used in chess as representation of the advantage. A centipawn is equal to 1/100th of a pawn. Therefore 100 centipawns = 1 pawn. These values play no formal role in the game but are useful to players, and essential in computer chess, for evaluating positions.

The top computer move will lose zero centipawns, but lesser moves will result in a deterioration of the position, measured in centipawns.

This value can be used as an indicator of the quality of play. The fewer centipawns one loses per move, the stronger the play.

The computer analysis on Lichess is powered by Stockfish.</string>
  <string name="insufficientMaterial">Losing on time, drawing and insufficient material</string>
  <string name="lichessFollowFIDErules">In the event of one player running out of time, that player will usually lose the game. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player\'s king by any possible series of legal moves (%1$s).

In rare cases this can be difficult to decide automatically (forced lines, fortresses). By default we always side with the player who did not run out of time.

Note that it can be possible to mate with a single knight or bishop if the opponent has a piece that could block the king.</string>

  <string name="discoveringEnPassant">Why can a pawn capture another pawn when it is already passed? (en passant)</string>
  <string name="explainingEnPassant">This is a legal move known as \"en passant\". The Wikipedia article gives a %1$s.

It is described in section 3.7 (d) of the %2$s:

\"A pawn occupying a square on the same rank as and on an adjacent file to an opponent’s pawn which has just advanced two squares in one move from its original square may capture this opponent’s pawn as though the latter had been moved only one square. This capture is only legal on the move following this advance and is called an ‘en passant’ capture.\"

See the %3$s on this move for some practice with it.</string>

Additionally, fivefold repetition always immediately ends the game.</string>
