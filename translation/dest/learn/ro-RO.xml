	<string name="senteGoesFirst">In shogi the player who goes first is called sente and the player who goes second is called gote. Sente is sometimes represented by black color and gote by white. Make any move as sente to continue.</string>

	<string name="grabAllTheStarsRemember">Grab all the stars! Remember, look outside of the board.</string>
	<string name="rookPromotion">The rook promotes to the powerful dragon. Don\'t forget that you can also promote your piece when you leave the promotion zone.</string>
	<string name="rookSummary">The rook can go up, down, left or right as much as it wants.</string>
	<string name="dragonSummary">It can move just like the unpromoted rook, but also one square in any diagonal direction, making it much stronger.</string>
	<string name="dragonSummaryTwo">The dragon can move just like the unpromoted rook, but also one square in any diagonal direction, making it much stronger.</string>
	<string name="grabAllTheStars">Prinde toate stelele!</string>
	<string name="theFewerMoves">The fewer moves you make, the more points you win!</string>
	<string name="rookComplete">Felicitări! Ai reușit să stăpânești turnul.</string>
	<string name="theBishop">Nebunul</string>
	<string name="itMovesDiagonally">Se mișcă în diagonală</string>
	<string name="bishopIntro">Următorul lucru pe care-l vom învăța este manevrarea nebunului!</string>
	<string name="ehThereIsNoPiece">Eh? There is no piece on the board. But look outside the board, a bishop! This area is where the pieces you captured go. You can place the piece back on the board. As usual, grab all the stars.</string>
	<string name="bishopPromotion">Promoting your bishop will make it stronger, it will turn into a piece called \"the horse\".</string>
	<string name="bishopSummary">The bishop moves in any diagonal direction.</string>
	<string name="horseSummary">The promoted bishop moves also diagonally, but it can also go one square up, down, left or right as well.</string>
	<string name="bishopComplete">Felicitări! Poți mânui un nebun.</string>
	<string name="theKing">Regele</string>
	<string name="theMostImportantPiece">Cea mai importantă piesă</string>

	<string name="theKnight">Calul</string>
	<string name="itMovesInAnLShape">It moves in an L shape, but only FORWARD!</string>
	<string name="knightIntro">Here\'s another challenge for you. The knight is... a tricky piece.</string>
	<string name="knightsHaveAFancyWay">Knights have a fancy way of jumping around!</string>
	<string name="knightsCanJumpOverObstacles">Knights can jump over obstacles!</string>
	<string name="knightSummary">The knight can jump in an L shape forward, but only by two squares forward and one square sideways. Its movement also isn\'t restricted by other pieces - it will just jump over them.</string>
	<string name="pknightSummary">Promoted knight moves are completely different from the unpromoted knight, but you can notice it moves the same as the gold general, so make sure to study that one thoroughly.</string>
	<string name="knightPromotion">The knight can also be promoted. His movements change a lot after that, so pay attention.</string>
	<string name="knightComplete">Felicitări! Ai învățat să folosești calul.</string>

	<string name="itMovesForwardOnly">March forward!</string>

	<string name="lanceIntro">Use it wisely.</string>
	<string name="lancesAreStraighforward">Just move forward as much as you can, this should be easy for you.</string>
	<string name="lancePromotion">After the lance is promoted, it moves differently, but you\'ve already seen this somewhere - same as the gold general.</string>
	<string name="lanceSummary">Moves forward, this is really easy.</string>
	<string name="planceSummary">It\'s the same as the gold general.</string>
	<string name="planceSummaryTwo">The promoted lance moves the same as the gold general.</string>
	<string name="lanceComplete">Great job!</string>
	<string name="theGold">The gold general</string>
	<string name="itMovesInAnyDirectionExceptDiagonallyBack">The gold general moves in any direction EXCEPT diagonally back.</string>
	<string name="goldIntro">The gold general movements might be a bit harder to remember at first, but you can surely do it.</string>
	<string name="goldDoesntPromote">The gold general together with the king is the only piece you CAN\'T promote.</string>

	<string name="boardSetupIntro">Cele două armate sunt față în față, gata pentru bătălie.</string>
	<string name="thisIsTheInitialPosition">This is the initial position
of every game of shogi!
Make any move to continue.</string>
	<string name="firstPlaceTheKing">There are two traditional ways of setting up pieces before a game. We will be teaching the Oohashi (大橋) style, most commonly used by professionals. The king goes first. Move the king to the back rank’s center square.</string>
	<string name="dropAGold">Drop a gold on the left side of the king, then place another gold on the right.</string>
	<string name="thenPlaceASilver">Then place the silver next to the left-side gold, and a silver beside the right gold.</string>
	<string name="dropTheKnights">Drop the knights the same way you placed the silvers. Your opponent will be doing the Itou (伊藤) style.</string>
	<string name="dropTheLances">Drop the lances. Your opponent will start placing pawns left-to-right before the lances. This is the Itou style.</string>
	<string name="placeTheBishopThenRook">Place the bishop above the left knight, then the rook above the right knight. Of course, in real games there is no need to be in sync with your opponent during setup.</string>
	<string name="placeThePawns">Finally, on the 3rd rank, drop pawns the same way you placed the back rank pieces. The circle will be your guide.</string>
	<string name="pushingThe3rdPawn">Pushing the 3rd pawn to open the bishop’s diagonal is the most common first move. Make this move to continue.</string>
	<string name="boardSetupComplete">Congratulations! You know how to set up the shogi board.</string>
	<string name="repetition">Repetition</string>

	<string name="repetitionIntro">Fourfold repetition is a draw Perpetual check is a loss.</string>
	<string name="ifTheSamePositionOccurs">If the same position occurs 4 times in Shogi, it is an automatic draw. This situation is called sennichite (千日手). Make the only legal move.</string>
	<string name="perpetualCheckIsALoss">But, perpetually checking the opponent’s king is a loss for the checking side. Unfortunately for your opponent, they don’t know! Make the only legal move.</string>
	<string name="boardFlippedFindBestMove">The board was just flipped. What is the best move here?</string>
	<string name="repetitionComplete">The idea behind perpetual check being a loss is to prevent anyone from forcing a draw.</string>

	<string name="theOpponentJustGaveAway">The opponent just gave away his valuable rook for free! Do you take it?</string>
	<string name="yourKingsValueIsInfinite">The king\'s value is infinite, compared to a rook. What is the best move here?</string>
	<string name="twoGeneralsAreBetter">Two generals can be worth more than one major piece. A knight and lance can be better than a general. Find a way to sacrifice the bishop and win two generals.</string>
	<string name="rememberWhichPieceIsTheMostValuable">Do you remember which piece is the most valuable?</string>
	<string name="takeThePieceWithTheHighestValue">Capturează piesa
cu cea mai mare valoare!</string>
	<string name="rememberTheKingIsMoreValuableThanEveryOtherPieceCombined">The king is more valuable than every other piece combined. It may be OK to sacrifice pieces to attack the opponent\'s king. Just don\'t forget your own king\'s safety as well!</string>
