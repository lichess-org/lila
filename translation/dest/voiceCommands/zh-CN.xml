  <string name="instructions2" comment="Voice commands can be misheard and Lichess will not always be fully certain what you said. Several arrows will be shown to identify e.g. if the move was 'b4' or 'd4', which often sound similar.&#10;&#10;These arrows will be in different colours (green, blue, etc) or labelled 1, 2, 3....&#10;You can then say the colour of the arrow (e.g. 'green') - or its number (e.g. '1'), to select that move.&#10;Users can configure if they choose from multiple moves based on colours or numbers.">当识别结果不确定时我们会以多个箭头展示可能的着法。请说出箭头的颜色或数字以选中它。</string>
  <string name="instructions3" comment="This is a complicated concept more easy to understand in practice. Voice commands can be misheard and Lichess will not always be fully certain what you said. Several arrows will be shown to identify e.g. if the move was 'b4' or 'd4', which often sound similar.&#10;The most likely move the player wants will have a circle showing around it, but it will be possible to cancel before it is played (for example, by shouting 'no!').&#10;&#10;You can see a visual example here: https://lichess.org/@/schlawg/blog/how-to-lichess-voice/nWrypoWI">当箭头展示出雷达扫描图案时，着法会在圆圈转完之后被走出。在这段时间内，您可以说 %1$s 来立即走出这一步， %2$s 来取消，或是说出另一个箭头的颜色/数字。此计时器可在设置中被调节或取消。</string>

  <string name="instructions5" comment="The phonetic alphabet is also known as the NATO alphabet (where A = Alpha, B = Bravo, etc. This makes the sounds easier to differentiate through a microphone). It is for English specifically, which as of the time of writing, is the only language supported by the Voice Commands feature.">使用音标字母来提高对棋盘竖线的识别精度。 </string>

  <string name="playPreferredMoveOrConfirmSomething" comment="Used in voice commands. When it is unclear what the player said (e.g. 'b4' and 'd4' sound similar), both moves will be shown, with the more likely one highlighted in a certain colour. By default, a countdown begins, and if no action is taken, the likely move (e.g. b4) will be played. Players can end the countdown early/confirm their move by saying 'yes'.&#10;&#10;For more details see https://lichess.org/@/schlawg/blog/how-to-lichess-voice/nWrypoWI">走语音识别为更相似的一步或确认某事</string>
  <string name="sleep" comment="Used for voice commands.&#10;&#10;By default, voice commands are always-on after the feature is enabled. Users can optionally set a word for listening to start, or say 'sleep' to disable listening.&#10;&#10;(Please note - this is not the same as recording, since the recording is never sent to Lichess; the speech technology is entirely offline)">休眠（如果唤醒词被启用）</string>
