  <string name="noAndYourNetworkIsGood">No. And your network is good.</string>
  <string name="noAndYourNetworkIsBad" comment="noAndYourNetworkIsBad&#10;&#10;The system checks the network lag and replies in response to the question &quot;Is Lichess lagging?&quot;&#10;In this case, it's the user's network connection that is making the game lag.">No. And your network is bad.</string>
  <string name="yesItWillBeFixedSoon">Yes. It will be fixed soon!</string>
  <string name="andNowTheLongAnswerLagComposedOfTwoValues">And now, the long answer! Game lag is composed of two unrelated values (lower is better):</string>
  <string name="lichessServerLatency">Lichess server latency</string>
  <string name="lichessServerLatencyExplanation">The time it takes to process a move on the server. It is the same for everybody, and only depends on the server load. The more players and the higher it gets, but Lichess developers do their best to keep it low. It rarely exceeds 10ms.</string>
  <string name="networkBetweenLichessAndYou">Network between Lichess and you</string>
  <string name="networkBetweenLichessAndYouExplanation">The time it takes to send a move from your computer to Lichess server, and get the response back. It\'s specific to your distance to Lichess (France) as well as the quality of your Internet connection. Lichess developers cannot fix your wifi or make light go faster.</string>
  <string name="youCanFindTheseValuesAtAnyTimeByClickingOnYourUsername">You can find both these values at any time, by clicking your username in the top bar.</string>
  <string name="lagCompensation">Lag compensation</string>
  <string name="lagCompensationExplanation">Lichess compensates network lag. This includes sustained lag and occasional lag spikes. Compensation limits and heuristics are based on time control and already compensated lag, so the result should feel reasonable for both players. As a result, having a higher network lag than your opponent is not a handicap!</string>
