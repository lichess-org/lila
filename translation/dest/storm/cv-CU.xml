  <string name="combo" comment="_Please make your translation as short and snappy as possible._&#10;In Puzzle Storm and Puzzle Racer, a 'Combo' is a consecutive sequence of correct moves. Each correct move fills the combo bar. When the bar is full, you get a time bonus, and you increase the value of the next bonus. If you make the wrong move, you lose your combo.&#10;&#10;This string is the title for your best combo, shown in the stats page after completing a run of puzzle storm or a puzzle race. It is also shown while you play.&#10;&#10;Used in the same way in both Puzzle Storm (https://lichess.org/storm) and Puzzle Racer (https://lichess.org/racer).">Комбо</string>
  <string name="time" comment="Time in this context means the total time that has passed in your previous run. The string is displayed after completing a run of Puzzle Storm (https://lichess.org/storm).&#10;&#10;Total time can vary depending on how well you do in puzzle storm. Winning puzzles builds up your combo and adds more time each time you complete a puzzle, while failing puzzles will reset your combo and also remove seconds from the clock.">Вӑхӑт</string>
