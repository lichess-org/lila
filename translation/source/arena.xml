  <string name="howAreScoresCalculated">How are scores calculated?</string>
  <string name="howAreScoresCalculatedAnswer">A loss always counts 0 points. A win counts 2 points (3 points using Berserk) and a draw 1 point unless you have won the two previous games, where a win counts 4 (5 points using Berserk) and a draw 2 points.

In other words, when you start the tournament, a win counts 2 points (3 points using Berserk), a draw 1 point and a loss 0 points.

After two consecutive wins, starting a "winning streak", each successive win counts 4 points (5 points using Berserk) and a red flame is displayed next to your score. When the winning streak (after two or more consecutive wins) ends with a draw, this counts as 2 points. When it ends with a loss, this counts as 0 points. When the winning streak ended, normal counting resumes until you start your next "winning streak" with two consecutive wins.

For example, from tournament start the game results win, draw, loss count as 2 (win) + 1 (draw) + 0 (loss) = 3 points. The game results win, win, win, draw, loss, win count as 2 (win) + 2 (win) + 4 (win) + 2 (draw) + 0 (loss) + 2 (win) = 12 points.</string>
<string name="berserk">Arena Berserk</string>
<string name="berserkAnswer">When a player clicks the Berserk button at the beginning of the game, they lose half of their clock time, but the win is worth one extra tournament point.

Going Berserk in time controls with an increment also cancels the increment (1+2 is an exception, it gives 1+0).

Berserk is not available for games with zero initial time (0+1, 0+2).

Berserk only grants an extra point if you play at least 7 moves in the game.</string>
<string name="howIsTheWinnerDecided">How is the winner decided?</string>
<string name="howIsTheWinnerDecidedAnswer">The player(s) with the most points at the conclusion of the tournament's set time limit will be announced winner(s).

When two or more players have the same number of points, the tournament performance is the tie break.</string>
<string name="howDoesPairingWork">How does the pairing work?</string>
<string name="howDoesPairingWorkAnswer">At the beginning of the tournament, players are paired based on their rating.
As soon as you finish a game, return to the tournament lobby: you will then be paired with a player close to your ranking. This ensures minimum wait time, however you may not face all other players in the tournament.
Play fast and return to the lobby to play more games and win more points.</string>
<string name="howDoesItEnd">How does it end?</string>
<string name="howDoesItEndAnswer">The tournament has a countdown clock. When it reaches zero, the tournament rankings are frozen, and the winner is announced. Games in progress must be finished, however they don't count for the tournament.</string>
