  <string name="howAreScoresCalculated">How are scores calculated?</string>
  <string name="howAreScoresCalculatedAnswer">A win has a base score of 2 points, a draw 1 point, and a loss is worth no points.
If you win two games consecutively you will start a double point streak, represented by a flame icon.
The following games will continue to be worth double points until you fail to win a game.
That is, a win will be worth 4 points, a draw 2 points, and a loss will still not award any points.

For example, two wins followed by a draw will be worth 6 points: 2 + 2 + (2 x 1)</string>
  <string name="berserk">Arena Berserk</string>
  <string name="berserkAnswer">When a player clicks the Berserk button at the beginning of the game, they lose half of their clock time, but the win is worth one extra tournament point.

Going Berserk in time controls with an increment also cancels the increment (1+2 is an exception, it gives 1+0).

Berserk is not available for games with zero initial time (0+1, 0+2).

Berserk only grants an extra point if you play at least 7 moves in the game.</string>
  <string name="howIsTheWinnerDecided">How is the winner decided?</string>

  <string name="howDoesPairingWork">How does the pairing work?</string>
  <string name="howDoesPairingWorkAnswer">At the beginning of the tournament, players are paired based on their rating.
As soon as you finish a game, return to the tournament lobby: you will then be paired with a player close to your ranking. This ensures minimum wait time, however you may not face all other players in the tournament.
Play fast and return to the lobby to play more games and win more points.</string>
