	<string name="introIntro">Your journey begins here.</string>
	<string name="choosePieceDesign">It's important that you can tell your pieces apart, so make sure you choose the right piece set. \nTo do that click on the cog wheel or your username (top right corner) and then click on &quot;piece set&quot;.</string>
	<string name="promotionZone">When some of your pieces reach or leave the first three ranks in your opponent's territory you can choose to promote your piece and make it stronger.</string>
	<string name="introComplete">You now know some basics, but this part of tutorial is still under construction. For now learn how individual pieces move.</string>
	<string name="theRook">The rook</string>

	<string name="rookIntro">The rook is a powerful piece. Are you ready to command it?</string>
	<string name="rookGoal">Click on the rook to bring it to the star!</string>
	<string name="rookPromotion">The rook promotes to a stronger - the dragon. Don't forget that you can also promote your piece when you leave the promotio zone.</string>
	<string name="rookSummary">The rook can go up, down, left or right as much as it wants.</string>
	<string name="dragonSummary">It can move just like the unpromoted rook, but also one square in any diagonal direction, making it much stronger.</string>
	<string name="grabAllTheStars">Grab all the stars!</string>

	<string name="bishopSummary">The bishop moves in any diagonal direction.</string>
	<string name="horseSummary">The promoted bishop moves also diagonally, but it can also go one square up, down, left or right as well.</string>

	<string name="knightsHaveAFancyWay">Knights have a fancy way of jumping around!</string>
	<string name="knightsCanJumpOverObstacles">Knights can jump over obstacles!</string>
	<string name="knightSummary">The knight can jump in an L shape forward, but only by two squares forward and one square sideways. Its movement also isn't restricted by other pieces - it will just jump over them.</string>
	<string name="pknightSummary">Promoted knight moves are completely different from the unpromoted knight, but you can notice it moves the same as the gold general, so make sure to study that one thoroughly.</string>
	<string name="knightPromotion">The knight can also be promoted. Its' movements change a lot after that, so pay attention.</string>
	<string name="knightComplete">Congratulations! You have mastered the knight.</string>

	<string name="lancePromotion">After the lance is promoted, it moves differently, but you've already seen this somewhere - sam as the gold general.</string>
	<string name="lanceSummary">Moves forward, this is really easy.</string>
	<string name="planceSummary">It't the same as the gold general.</string>
