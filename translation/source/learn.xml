	<string name="bishopPromotion">Promoting your bishop will make it stronger, it will turn into a piece called "the horse".</string>
	<string name="bishopSummary">The bishop moves in any diagonal direction.</string>

	<string name="knightsCanJumpOverObstacles">Knights can jump over obstacles!</string>
	<string name="knightSummary">The knight can jump in an L shape forward, but only by two squares forward and one square sideways. Its movement also isn't restricted by other pieces - it will just jump over them.</string>
	<string name="pknightSummary">Promoted knight moves are completely different from the unpromoted knight, but you can notice it moves the same as the gold general, so make sure to study that one thoroughly.</string>

	<string name="lancePromotion">After the lance is promoted, it moves differently, but you\'ve already seen this somewhere - same as the gold general.</string>
	<string name="lanceSummary">Moves forward, this is really easy.</string>
	<string name="planceSummary">It\'s the same as the gold general.</string>

of every game of shogi!
Make any move to continue.</string>
    <string name="firstPlaceTheKing">There are two traditional ways of setting up pieces before a game. We will be teaching the Oohashi (大橋) style, most commonly used by professionals. The king goes first. Move the king to the back rank’s center square.

    <string name="placeTheBishopThenRook">Place the bishop above the left knight, then the rook above the right knight. Of course, in real games there is no need to be in sync with your opponent during setup.</string>
    <string name="placeThePawns">Finally, on the 3rd rank, drop pawns the same way you placed the back rank pieces. The circle will be your guide.</string>
    <string name="pushingThe3rdPawn">Pushing the 3rd pawn to open the bishop’s diagonal is the most common first move. Make this move to continue.</string>
