{ The initial game of a World Championship match is always a bit specific. Both players have come there very well prepared, but they know little about the opponent's preparation. Is the opponent willing to enter a theoretical debate, repeating the same openings again or again, or is he going to vary them, coming with many surprising lines for one or two games? In the initial games
the players are also trying to learn as much as possible about the opponent's preparation, while trying not to reveal much about their own. It makes sense to surprise the opponent, but one should not take too many risks, as a loss in a relatively short match might cause a player big problems. }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 { Contrary to many other top players, Ding Liren mostly plays 3...a6, although he sometimes plays Berlin, too. Ian Nepomniachtchi has undoubtedly prepared some dangerous ideas against it. } 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Bxc6 { This move probably came as a surprise. As far as I know, Ian
Nepomniachtchi had not played this move before. White steers the game into a less explored position with some imbalances. Black's doubled pawn is not much of a problem. On the other hand, his bishop pair is not so strong so far. Why
White did not take on c6 already on move 4? Black's e5-pawn might hang in many lines, and Black will need to spend the extra tempo on protecting it. Objectively speaking, White has no advantage here, but it is the case with most topical lines nowadays. The element of surprise can be quite important, as Ian Nepomniachtchi has surely studied the resulting positions deeper. } (6.

there. }) 10. hxg4 Bxg4 { looks fine for Black, but it is mostly a good idea to avoid the sharpest lines when a well-prepared opponent surprises you.

The position resembles the Berlin defense, but in our game the pawn formation a5-b6-c5-c7 is more vulnerable, as a loss of the c7-pawn could cost Black another pawn and a game. In Berlin endgames such a danger hardly exists with Black's king on the queenside, and even with Black's king on the kingside White mostly needs to sacrifice a pawn (e5-e6) to win the c7-pawn and perhaps another one.

Starting from move 27, Ding Liren demonstrated a high-level defense and made a draw. With the current level of preparation and play, it is very hard to win a classical game against a top player who acts solidly. That said, I am sure that we will see such games soon.

Black had a wide choice, but needed to show some cards, as some of the available plans cannot be combined. (Say, both c7-c6 and c7-c5 are reasonable options here, but playing c7-c6-c5 is rarely good here.) Ian Nepomniachtchi decided to steer play into the Queen's Gambit Accepted, where h2-h3 is not the most useful move. } (4... c5!? { looks very reasonable, as the engine's top line } 5. cxd5 (5. e3 { is always an option, but hardly dangerous for Black. }) 5... exd5 6. g3 { does not look impressive with the inclusion of the h2-h3 advance, which somewhat weakens White's kingside. }) (4... c6 5. e3 { leads to a Slav position where h2-h3 is a reasonable move, though not the most ambitious one. } (5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bf4 Bf5)) (4... a6!? { is a witty reply to White's previous move. White can react with } 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bf4 { , hoping for a
slight edge. }) (4... Be7 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bf4 { leads to a line where the h2-h3
advance is useful, although Black should be doing well after } 6... c6 7. Nc3 Bf5 8. g4 Be4!? { . }) (4... Nbd7 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bf4 Bb4+!? { is another case of a
dynamic equilibrium. }) 5. e3 c5 6. Bxc4 a6 7. O-O { We have transposed to a Queen's Gambit Accepted with a rather unusual h2-h3 move, which is not bad at all. } 7... Nc6 { This move cost Black another 9 minutes. } (7... b5 8. Be2 Nbd7 { was a relevant alternative. White might have a slight initiative after } 9. a4!? b4 10. Nbd2 Bb7 11. b3 { , but the position does not look too scary for Black. }) 8. Nc3 (8. dxc5 Qxd1 9. Rxd1 Bxc5 { leads to a symmetric position
where White cannot hope for much. That said, } 10. Nfd2!? O-O 11. Nb3 Be7 12. Nc3 { still promises him mild initiative. }) 8... b5 9. Bd3 Bb7 { Black managed to develop his pieces. Such positions are considered good for him, but Ding Liren had a concrete idea in mind. } (9... cxd4!? 10. exd4 Nb4!? { was a more
circumspect option, as Black should be doing well after } (10... Be7 11. a4 bxa4 { is another relevant option, but } 12. Ne5 { requires some precision from Black: } 12... Bb7! 13. Rxa4 (13.

but Black's pieces are more active. }) 11. Be2 Be7 12. a4 bxa4 13.

dangerous for Black. }) 14. Ne4 { Black has to tread carefully to avoid problems with his weak c4-pawn or undeveloped kingside }) (10... cxd4 { gives White an extra option } 11. axb5!? (11. exd4 { might transpose to 10...b4 followed by 11.

My first independent move often turns out to be inaccurate. It occasionally happens even to stronger players. } (12. Nxc5! Bxc5 13. dxc5 { was more promising. Black can regain the pawn in many ways, but White has a bishop pair in an open position, which often ensures him an edge. } 13... Be4! { is the critical option, which looks very good for Black at first sight and not bad under a closer inspection, either: } (13...

logical move, but even more concrete action was needed. } (16. Qe1! f5! 17. Qe2! (17. d5 O-O-O! 18. Bxb4 Bxb4 19. Qxb4 fxe4 20. Bxe4 Qf4! 21. Qc5+ Kb8 22. Qe3! Qxe3 23. fxe3 f5! 24. Bc2 Bxd5 25. Rae1 Nc6 26. e4 fxe4 27. Bxe4 $15) 17... O-O-O 18. Rad1 { leads to a position with mutual chances.

precisely. }) 16... O-O-O 17. Bd3?! { This is logical but wrong. White spent 15 minutes on this move and then played the next one very quickly. } (17. Qe1! f5! 18.

equal, but Black has a huge positional advantage. His pieces are more active.

exchange to further activate his pieces. } 21. Nxg5 Nxd4 22. Qh5 f6 (22... Bc5!?) 23. Nf3? { White faced a very difficult choice, but this move simplifies
Black's task. Given that all the options were bad, it made sense to complicate the position.

A convincing victory with Black! That said, the match has just begun and there are many games left. Hopefully the Chinese grandmaster recovers from a loss and we will be able to see a dramatic match of two elite players! } 0-1

complex, as both sides have a multitude of plans. The resulting positions

Dvoretsky was travelling there often. } 6... h6 { This push had been considered

becomes an option and even h3-h4 could be good after a thorough preparation.

0.00. }) 29. Rxd4! { The pieces which remain on the board are more important

Ding Liren has played a great positional game and has levelled the match score.
Now he might enjoy some psychological advantage, as he has the momentum on his
side. On the other hand, there is a rest day ahead and then Ian Nepomniachtchi
is going to play the next game with White, which means that he has enough time
to get over the loss. After all, the score is equal now and the players are
similarly strong. (They are both very strong.) This means that the importance
of every game increases, particularly when it does not finish with a draw. The
match is going to be dramatic, which is good for spectators! } 1-0

[Opening "Ruy Lopez: Closed, Martinez Variation"]

{ Before going into the game, We must remember that psychologically, Ding had the advantage after a horrible blunder from Ian in Game 4.

Fortunately, Ian got a rest day to recover after his loss. It was pretty much clear he would go for 1. e4, the reason being that he posed problems in Game 1 and did not achieve anything with 1.d4 in game 3.

Another important point to be noted is that Ian's team, after knowing Richard Rapport is helping Ding, might have thought Ian should play 1.d4 while they will be finding ideas in all the surprise variations Richard could suggest to Ding. }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. d3 { In Game 1, Ian chose 6.Bxc6 and soon got a pleasant advantage. However, playing it a second time won't have the same effect as Ding's team will be prepared for this. White threatens to take on c6 with the Bishop and capture the e5 pawn. } (6. Re1 { We can only assume where Ding intended to go after this. My guess would be the Marshal attack. } 6... b5 7. Bb3 O-O { We might see this in the later part of the match. It largely depends on what will be the score in the match. }) 6... b5 7. Bb3 d6 { Now that the d6 pawn protects the pawn on e5, Black intends to go Na5 and capture the Bishop on b3. Who doesn't like to have the advantage of the bishop pair?! } (7... O-O!? { While 7...d6 is the most played move in this variation, 7...0-0 is equally interesting. Black keeps the option of
bringing the dark square Bishop to c5 before playing d6. Another idea for Black is that, at times they can push the pawn directly to d5 without spending a move on playing d6. }) 8. c3 { Apart from this move, White also played 8.a4, 8.a3. All three moves are equally popular, and each has a different way of developing pieces. I don't rule out the possibility of Ian playing either 8.a3 or 8.a4 in the later part of the match. The main purpose of 8. c3 is to create a window (c2 square) for the light square Bishop if Black were to play Na5. it is also useful when he is planning to go d4 in the future. } (8. a4!?) (8. a3!?) 8... O-O 9. h3 { White also has the option to play 9.Re1 or 9.Nbd2. 9.Re1 is the popular choice with many top-level games. 9.h3
has the main idea to prevent Black's light square Bishop from coming to g4, thereby pinning the Knight on f3. } (9. Re1!?) (9. Nbd2!?) 9... Bb7 (9... Na5!? { is the most played move in
this position. } 10. Bc2 c5 11. d4 { White could reach this position with 6. Re1 without wasting a move on d3. In such cases, it allows various other options for Black. So it is perceived that this is a clever move to avoid some forcing Marshal variations. So it is still debatable whether the rook is better placed on e1 or f1. }) 10. a4 Na5 11. Ba2 c5 12. Bg5 { This is the first new move in the game. 12. Na3 has been played in the game between Firouzja vs Giri in Miami 2022. } 12... h6 { This natural move was played after 13 minutes of thought.
At this point, we can conclude that Ian wins the opening battle. } (12... d5!? { an interesting idea for Black in the spirit of the Marshal attack. It is important to understand the psychological effect of Ian blitzing out all his moves must have affected Ding greatly. We can only contemplate that Ding has spent some time on this move but rejected fearing falling into Ian's
preparation. } 13. Nxe5 (13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Bxd5 Bxd5 15. exd5 Qxd5 { Doesn't yield much for white either. }) 13... dxe4 14. dxe4 c4! { A nice move restricting the activity of the bishop a2, which participates in attacking the f7 pawn along with the Knight on e5. Yes, Black is a pawn down. But Black's piece coordination fully compensates the pawn. } (14... Bxe4? { Immediate capture of the pawn leads to a passive position. } 15. Qxd8 Bxd8 (15...

Rxa5 $18 { White is simply an exchange and a pawn up. }) 16. Re1 Bb7 17. Na3 $16 { To understand who has an advantage, it is always good to start from which side has good piece coordination and placement of pieces. Here we can see White pieces are much better placed with rook occupying e-file Knight on e5 and Bishop on a2 keeping an eye on f7 pawn. Therefore white has a huge advantage here. }) (14...

Rxa5 { Once again, white, with the help of a simple tactic, won an exchange and pawn. }) 15. Qxd8 Rfxd8 $44 { We don't have to worry about the f7 as the Bishop on a2 is closed. }) 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. axb5 axb5 15. Nbd2 Nc6 16. Bd5 { So far, both the players have played naturally developing moves. Now that the a-file is open, Black wants to control the a-file. Whereas White would aim to bring the Knight to e3 to take control of d5 square, which is huge and the main weakness in Black's camp. } 16... Rxa1 17. Qxa1 Qd7 18. Re1 { White is not interested in contesting for the file. Instead, he is going to reroute the Knight on d2-f1-e3-d5 or f5. This is a typical idea in the Spanish Opening. While the general principle is of occupying the open files first, it has an exception of taking control of opponents' weak squares! } 18... Ra8 19. Qd1 Bd8 { This move was played after 7-minute thought, which is puzzling to me. Black has a clear plan of bringing the Bishop to b6 and activating it by playing c4. The question is, does Black have so much time to execute? } (19... Ne7 { Engine suggests many moves. But I like this move as Black challenges the monstrous Bishop on d5. As the
White Knight needs some time to reach the d5 square, the Black can push the pawn on d6 and eliminate the weakness. } 20. Bxb7 Qxb7 21. Nf1 d5 22.

[Opening "Ruy Lopez: Berlin Defense"]

{ After missing several chances in Game 8, Ding had to deal with rumoured discovery of his training games against Rapport. Although Ding denied having any knowledge of these games, one can only imagine which sane player would accept that the games truly were part of their preparation. Psychologically it must be quite hard for Ding to choose the opening from the Black side. }
1. e4 { I expect Nepo to go for 1.e4 for his remaining white games in the match. } 1... e5 { After trying out the French defense in Game 7, Ding returns to his main choice against 1.e4. Although it was a good surprise, the French defense can hardly be repeated. The team of Nepo would have checked by now. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 { So finally, the Berlin Defense. One important thing we can notice is that Ding keeps jumping and trying new openings in all the games. While Nepo has stuck to his main openings. We can conclude that both Ding and Nepo trust in the opening preparation of Nepo!
The Berlin defense is considered a solid opening with considerably less theory to remember than the Sicilian defense or the Marshal. Decades ago, The Berlin defense was mainly played by GM Aleksandrov. At that time, players used to criticise the early trade of queens, and it was considered a lazy opening due to the little theory one has to study.
In 2001, GM Vladimir Kramnik successfully employed the Berlin defense to win the match against GM Garry Kasparov. From thereon, we can witness enormous development in the Berlin defense. Some top players employ only the Berlin defense, which shows how solid opening it is for Black. } 4. d3 { Keeping the tension in the center. The most challenging option for White. White intends to capture on c6, followed by the e5 pawn. } (4. O-O Nxe4 5. d4 (5. Re1 { This is one of those moves where White controls everything and tries out small ideas to pressure Black. } 5...

By moving the bishop on c5, Black intends to play Nc5 followed by Be6. Once the light square bishops are exchanged, Black can push pawns on the queenside. }) 17. Qe2 Rb8?! { Inaccuracy. Giving the initiative to White.it is important to have the option of Be6 when White is launching an attack with both the knights. } (17... Bf8!? 18. axb5 cxb5 19.

{ With five rounds go, the pressure is mounting on Ding as he trails by a point. While Nepo stuck to his main choice of openings barring game 3, Ding has been switching openings.

So naturally, chess fans, including myself, were curious to see how Ding would approach his openings after the rather unexpected discovery of his team training games came out in public - although of course, we can only assume that they were between Ding and Rapport.

I am surprised by his choice. I expected Ding to try 1.e4 at some point during the match, as it would make Nepo's team work on it and make Nepo remember more. }
1. c4 { Despite winning in game six and close to winning game 8, Ding decided to switch back to 1.c4, which he successfully played in game 4.
During a match, switching openings from the white side is a good idea to make your opponent remember. } 1... Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e4 (4. e3!? { Game 4 went in this direction. Naturally, Ding did not repeat it. }) 4... Bc5 { This was a natural choice for Nepo. Unlike in 4. ..Bb4, white is obliged to enter, forcing variations and having many choices for black makes it harder for white to prepare all the details. Black intends to take control of d4 square. Therefore white challenges it by playing... } (4... Bb4!? { An equally popular move at the top level. }) 5. Nxe5 Nxe5 6. d4 Bb4 7. dxe5 Nxe4 { Until here, both of the players have chosen logical moves. Here white has a couple of queen moves. Now white has to pick one which will pose the maximum problems for black. } 8. Qf3 (8. Qd4!? { The reason for placing the queen on d4 is to control the c5 square. The disadvantage of this move is, it can't go to g3 square but to g4, where white has to waste a move due to d5 square. } 8... Nxc3 9. bxc3 Be7 10. Qg4 g6 $13) (8. Qg4?!

It was not hard to guess that Nepo would go for 4...Bc5, and all team had to analyse was 9... Ba5,Bc5 and Be7. It was either a poor choice of opening, or this opening was checked just on the rest day. Either way, it is a psychological advantage for Nepo in the match. } (9...

On the other hand, the player who is trailing should put pressure from the white side. For Nepo, this game can be seen as a success. He came well-prepared and played the endgame well. I can only imagine what kind of pressure the players are going through. Nepo will not go for anything crazy in the next four games. } 1/2-1/2

{ As the match is near the end, one can expect Ding to take his chances from the white side in this game. At the same time, the real question is about the strategy in choosing the opening.

Now we move on to the tie breaks. In the rapid portion, the match should be balanced. However, if it were to proceed to the blitz, I rate Nepo as the favourite. } 1/2-1/2
