Regarding rating refunds

To receive rating refunds certain conditions must be met, in order to mitigate rating inflation. These conditions were not met in this case.

Warning: Username or profile that implies you are a titled player

The username policy (https://github.com/ornicar/lila/wiki/Username-policy) for Lichess states that you can't have a username that implies that you have a FIDE title or the Lichess Master title, or impersonating a specific titled player. Actual titled players can verify using the form here (https://lichess.org/verify-title) with evidence that documents their identity, e.g. a scanned ID card, driving license, passport or similar. We will then verify your identity and title, and your title will be shown in front of your username and on your Lichess user profile. Since your username or profile implies that you have a title, we reserve the right to close your account within two weeks, if you have not verified your title within that time.

""", /* ---------------------------------------------------------------*/ """

Account marked for computer assistance

Our cheating detection algorithms have marked your account for using computer assistance. If you want to contest the mark, please send an email to Lichess Contact contact@lichess.org. If you are a titled player, we will need a proof of your identity. It can be a picture of a document, like an ID card or a driving license. You can verify your title using the form at lichess.org/help/master .

Warning: leaving games / stalling on time

In your game history, you have several games where you have left the game or just let the time run out instead of playing or resigning.
This can be very annoying for your opponents. If this behavior continues to happen, we may be forced to terminate your account.

Title Verification

Unfortunately we had to reject your title verification. You are free to make another application with the appropriate documentation.
